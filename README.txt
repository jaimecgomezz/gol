game of life backend implementation


why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
firstly, the relatively simple nature of the game and the eventual complexity
that can emerge from it really got me fixated since the first time I learn about
it

secondly, i'm interested in learning a new language, lua in this case, which
seems to be a interesting choice given its relatively niche usage, but i've
reading a lot of cool stuff about the language, so i'm having high hopes for it,
although there's nothing written in stone
